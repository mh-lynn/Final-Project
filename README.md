# Final-Project

This is a project that was worked on in class with a group, while this was a group project I have removed the parts of it that I didn't work on and it in no way obscures the flow of the project or included presentation. 

This project consisted of three parts 
Part 1, was Red team oriented and focused on finding vulnerabilities to exploit, exploiting those vulnerabilities and retrieving hidden flags.

Part 2, was Blue team oriented and focused on monitoring the targets, looking at patterns of traffic and behavior and providing ways to mitigate future attacks.

Part 3, was network analysis of a different enviorment, this consisted of capturing preloaded "Live" traffic on a VM and analyzing the caputred traffic to see what has been going on in the network and what files or malware had been installed. 


The Engagement Analysis breaks down in detail the steps taken during the project and there is also an included slideshow which was made to be presented to the class at the end of the course.
